## Reference the Figma here
https://www.figma.com/design/VwFkVrRDZtMjWtokRgY6EN/IMPRINT-Website?node-id=0-1&t=rD2eTYsDFpy4Mju0-1

## Tasks:

1. Jean & Tracy - Landing 
2. Arvin - Team
3. Shashvath - About
4. Hannah - Sponsors
5. Sarah & Taneesha - Speakers

# IMPORTANT: 
1. Make sure images go into /public (otherwise when we host the site they wont be seen)

2. Dont worry about mobile responsiveness too much, we can deal with that later when needed!
Remember to test different screen sizes using your browser's developer tools. Tailwind allows you specify different CSS styles for different screen sizes using s, m, l, xl!

3. Get the site looking as close to the figma design as possible first (You can do this by clicking dev mode (bottom toolbar in Figma), clicking on an element, and using its already existing layout & style code. NOTE THIS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIVE FOR MOBILE AT FIRST!)

4. Use Tailwind CSS by using className prop (its already globally imported!). Please note that Figma by default
is written in regular HTML/CSS, but you can translate all of that into tailwind (AI helps here)

5. Our deadline to release this website is 3/16. You know your pace!
