# Reference the Figma here
https://www.figma.com/design/VwFkVrRDZtMjWtokRgY6EN/IMPRINT-Website?node-id=0-1&t=rD2eTYsDFpy4Mju0-1

## Tasks:

1. Jean & Tracy - Landing 
2. Arvin - Team
3. Shashu - About
4. Hannah - Sponsors
5. Sarah & Taneesha - Speakers

# IMPORTANT: 
1. Worry about mobile responsiveness LATER!

2. Get the site looking as close to the figma design as possible first!(Remember you can do this by clicking dev mode (bottom toolbar), clicking on an element, and using its already existing layout & style code)

3. Use Tailwind CSS by using className prop (its already globally imported!). Please note that Figma by default
is written in regular HTML/CSS, but you can translate all of that into tailwind (AI helps here!)


## Build (optional)
npm run build
